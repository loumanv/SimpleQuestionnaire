SimpleQuestionnaire
===================

This iOS app implements a simple questionnaire. The user starts the questionnaire and replies to questions. At the end the user can see the result of the questionnaire. Al the questions, the answers and the resulted text are stored in an XML file. Finally there is another tab that also reads web links from the XML file and shows them on a table that drills down to the web page.
